subtitle: Visual Studio Code extension
body: This is a zero-configuration language support extension, built as a personal project over several months, and which leverages Microsoft's <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a>.
  
  The extension is written in TypeScript, has a test suite built with <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>, and I designed the <a href="https://github.com/admvx/as2-language-support/blob/main/icon.svg">extension logo</a> in Adobe Illustrator.

title: Pre-Apt
page_title: PreApt
subtitle: Electron-based UI debugger
body: PreApt is a tool I designed and built to accelerate the UI development workflow of my team at Electronic Arts. Previously, all UI testing was conducted in game, requiring a lengthy compilation process for each iteration, which PreApt eliminates.
  
  The application employs several exotic strategies to patch the supporting codebase and achieve compatibility with the full-blown game engine, while extending functionality to aid in debugging. It makes use of multithreading to monitor and serve local source files, and to run Perforce queries on available workspaces.

body: This is a short demo reel showcasing some of the UI work I've completed over the past few years at Electronic Arts.
  
  In the video linked below, the visual and motion designs were provided by external or in-house artists, while I responsible for the in-game implementation.

id: chat-builder
title: Chat Builder
subtitle: Conversational AI script editor + chat system
body: While tasked with researching chatbot technologies, I proposed, designed and implemented this pair of systems for authoring + rendering chatbot content.
  
  This solution has been used successfully in building automated behavioural coaches, and allows copy writers and developers to collaborate directly within the same application.

page_title: Personal portfolio site
low_opacity: true
subtitle: Personal portfolio site
body: In developing this website, I took the somewhat impractical approach of designing and building it in unison, starting with the <strong>admvx</strong> handle, deriving a polygonal motif from the letterforms and working outwards from there.
  
  I chose <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> as the foundational technology, pared down the 3D library <a href="http://seenjs.io/">seen.js</a> to render the polyhedron, and developed several bespoke animation solutions to achieve the inertia-centric motion design.

id: factor-fusion
title: Factor Fusion
subtitle: Web + mobile mini-game
body: Factor Fusion is the most recent of four educational games I developed for <a href="https://www.gene.com/">Genentech</a>, focussing on the mechanics of blood coagulation. I was responsible for the full implementation, audio design and gameplay animation – and had the privilege of co-designing the concept + visual style with talented colleagues.
  
  The game uses <a href="https://pixijs.com/">Pixi.js</a> for WebGL accelerated rendering, along with the <a href="https://chipmunk-physics.net/">Chipmunk physics engine</a> – enhanced with magnetic behaviours – to drive the puzzle solving interaction.

low_opacity: true
subtitle: GIF-generating Twitter bot
body: While I would ultimately consider this a failed experiment in generative satire, Trump Tribune met my technical ambitions and was a mild salve to the feeling of helpless dismay conjured by the Trump administration.
  
  The bot runs on Node.js to serve a private web app – comprised of generative text, SVG and Google-Image-Searched pictorial content – before capturing an image sequence through the headless browser library <a href="https://pptr.dev/">Puppeteer</a>, and assembling those frames into the GIF that's ultimately published through the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/">Twitter API</a>.

subtitle: Art project + gallery site
body: During 2015 and 2016 I completed a 100-day art+design exercise to challenge myself and expand my skillset, posting the results each day on my Twitter account.

  This gallery site collects my output from the project and was built using Angular 2 (during the brief period that it existed). The source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/admvx/gallery">Github</a>.

title: Mission MRD
subtitle: Touchscreen educational game
body: Mission MRD is another educational game authored for <a href="https://www.gene.com/">Genentech</a>, this time with a focus on the concept of Minimal Residual Disease.
  
  My contribution to this project was the technical design and implementation, along with gameplay animation, while other colleagues provided conceptual and visual designs. The tech stack is similar to that of Factor Fusion, though in this case the simple physics behaviours are bespoke.

title: Thought Toilet
subtitle: Realtime Twitter monitor
body: Besides providing an excuse to learn a new web framework, I designed and built this web app as a means of highlighting just how much noise there is out there in the Twittersphere.

  The back-end runs on Node.js to access the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/">Twitter API</a>, while the front-end uses a homespun tweening engine in addition to version 1.x of Angular.

body: My profile on <a href="https://codepen.io/">codepen.io</a> is a fairly even split of technical tests (proving a concept, or making cross-device comparisons) and CSS-centric generative animations.
  
  While the latter entries make for more stimulating viewing, it’s possible to see a through-line from the tech tests to several of the projects documented here.

subtitle: Mobile app illustrations
body: My brief on this project was to devise visual concepts to accompany articles, tasks and achievements unlocked within a smoking cessation app, and then realize them as minimal vector illustrations in accordance with the established look and feel.
  
  The linked gallery highlights some of the 80+ illustrations I produced for the iCanQuit app.
